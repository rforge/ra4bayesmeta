Description: Functionality for performing a principled reference analysis in the Bayesian normal-normal hierarchical model (NNHM) used for Bayesian meta-analysis. Computes a reference posterior, induced by a minimally informative improper reference prior for the between-study (heterogeneity) standard deviation. Determines additional proper conservative (and anti-conservative) prior benchmarks. Includes functions for reference analyses at both the posterior and the prior level, which, given the data, quantify the informativeness of a heterogeneity prior of interest relative to the minimally informative reference prior and the proper prior benchmarks. The functions operate on data sets which are compatible with the bayesmeta R package on CRAN.
